## Why a catalog matters

Skills become more valuable when they are searchable and easy to reuse. A clean catalog also lets you build topical pages that Google can crawl.

## Suggested structure

- Home page with the most important categories
- List page that covers every skill
- Detail page with full instructions and a copy button

## Keep it fresh

Publish short posts every week: new skills, use-case spotlights, or lessons from real deployments.
