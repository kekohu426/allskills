If this is your first time with Skills, follow these three steps to get started.

## Step 1: Choose a Skill

Go to the Skills page on AllSkills.cn, find what you need by category or search.

## Step 2: Copy Instructions

Open the Skill detail page and click "Copy Skill" to copy the full instructions to your clipboard.

## Step 3: Paste and Add Your Request

Paste the skill instructions in Claude's chat, then add your specific task. For example:

```
Use this Skill to help me generate a growth analysis report for SaaS startup teams.
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Only pasting partial content**: Copy the complete Skill instructions
- **No clear goal**: Add your scenario, objectives, and constraints
- **Too many tasks at once**: Break into 2-3 clear subtasks first

## Advanced Tips

- Save frequently used Skills to Claude Projects
- Build a "skill library list" for your team and iterate
- After each generation, save effective prompts as templates
