Canvas Design works like a design director: it confirms style, layout, and information hierarchy before outputting actionable design instructions. Here's a complete workflow using a real event poster request.

## Use Cases

- Offline event/meetup promotional posters
- Course or livestream covers
- Social media promotional images

## What You Need to Prepare

- Event theme and time
- One-line selling point
- Visual keywords (style/color/texture)
- Target dimensions (e.g., 1080x1920)

## Step 1: Copy the Skill Instructions

Go to the Canvas Design detail page on AllSkills.cn, click copy, and paste the complete Skill instructions into Claude's chat.

## Step 2: Add Your Specific Requirements

Example request (feel free to modify):

```
Please generate a design brief for a 1080x1920 event poster:
- Event name: AI Product Growth Meetup
- Date & location: Jan 18 · Shenzhen
- One-line pitch: From 0 to 1 in AI product growth
- Style keywords: minimal, metallic, tech, blue-green gradient
- Visual elements: abstract geometry + light beams
- Output: layout structure, color scheme, font combinations, hierarchy
```

## Step 3: Get Actionable Design Specs

Canvas Design will output:

- Visual structure (background, main element, supporting elements)
- Color scheme and gradient suggestions
- Font combinations (title/body/emphasis)
- Layout hierarchy and alignment rules

## Step 4: Execute

Take the output to Figma, Canva, or Photoshop. Suggest 2-3 rounds of refinement:

- Adjust title weight
- Enhance contrast
- Optimize reading flow

## FAQ

- **No design software?** Canva works too—focus on following the layout and hierarchy.
- **Not polished enough?** Improve background layers and shadow contrast, avoid too many colors.

## Summary

Canvas Design is great for generating design briefs. Write clear requirements, and it delivers professional solutions that save you hours of brainstorming.
