## Advanced Search Strategies

### Time-Sensitive Searches

For daily reports, use date filters:
- Google: Tools → Any time → Past 24 hours
- Search operators: `after:2024-01-26` or `before:2024-01-27`

### Site-Specific Searches

Use `site:` operator for targeted searches:
```
"GPT-5" site:techcrunch.com
"new AI model" site:arxiv.org
"AI funding" site:venturebeat.com
```

### Topic Clustering

Group related searches for comprehensive coverage:

**Model Releases**:
- "new language model 2024"
- "LLM release announcement"
- "open source AI model"

**Research Papers**:
- "arxiv AI paper [date]"
- "machine learning breakthrough"
- "NeurIPS ICML ICLR accepted papers"

**Business News**:
- "AI startup funding"
- "artificial intelligence acquisition"
- "AI company valuation"

### Multi-Language Searches

For global coverage, search in multiple languages:
- English: "AI news today"
- Chinese: "人工智能新闻" or "AI最新动态"
- Japanese: "AI ニュース"

### Trend Identification

Search for emerging patterns:
- "AI trends 2024"
- "most popular AI tools"
- "AI adoption statistics"

## Content Verification

### Cross-Reference Strategy

Verify significant claims by:
1. Checking original source (company blog, research paper)
2. Finding coverage from 2+ independent sources
3. Looking for official announcements or press releases

### Red Flags

Be cautious of:
- Unverified rumors or speculation
- Single-source stories without corroboration
- Sensationalized headlines without substance
- Outdated information presented as new

### Fact-Checking Resources

- Company official websites and blogs
- Research paper repositories (arXiv, ACL Anthology)
- Press release distribution services
- Academic institution announcements
